# 👋 Hi, I’m Carolina

I’m an aspiring AI engineer with a strong interest in **large language models (LLMs)**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **trustworthy AI systems**. I enjoy building applied ML projects that sit at the intersection of theory and real-world impact, especially around transparency, reliability, and human-centered AI.

I’m particularly interested in:
- Large language models and prompt engineering  
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems  
- Reducing hallucinations and improving model reliability  
- Model evaluation, interpretability, and responsible AI  
- Applied ML systems and MLOps workflows  

This GitHub serves as a space to document my learning, experiments, and end-to-end projects as I work toward becoming an AI engineer.

## Current Projects

### 🤟 Real-Time ASL Translator
A real-time American Sign Language (ASL) translation system that uses computer vision and hand tracking to recognize signed letters and convert them into text.

**Key ideas & features:**
- Real-time hand detection and landmark tracking using MediaPipe
- Multiple implementations (web-based, rule-based, and ML-powered) to explore different design tradeoffs
- Rule-based gesture recognition for interpretable, geometry-driven classification
- Neural network–based models (TensorFlow / PyTorch) for improved accuracy and scalability
- End-to-end ML pipeline including data collection, preprocessing, training, and inference
- Low-latency, live translation with extensible support for custom datasets and new signs

This project explores the intersection of computer vision, human–computer interaction, and machine learning, with a focus on accessibility, real-time systems, and comparing symbolic versus learned approaches to perception.

### 🤖 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot
An end-to-end RAG chatbot designed to answer questions grounded in a specific document corpus rather than relying solely on model memory.

**Key ideas & features:**
- Document ingestion, chunking, and vector storage  
- Semantic retrieval to surface relevant context  
- LLM-based answer generation constrained by retrieved sources  
- Explicit handling of “I don’t know” cases to reduce hallucinations  
- Emphasis on evaluation, citation, and reliability

This project reflects my interest in **trustworthy LLM applications**, particularly in how retrieval, prompting, and evaluation can be combined to improve factual accuracy.

### 📚 Semantic Book Recommender
A recommendation system that goes beyond keyword matching by leveraging **semantic embeddings** to understand user intent and content similarity.

**Key ideas & features:**
- Uses embedding-based similarity to recommend books by meaning, not just keywords  
- Supports flexible, natural-language user queries  
- Focuses on explainability (why a book was recommended)  
- Designed as a modular ML pipeline (data → embeddings → retrieval → ranking)

This project explores how representation learning can improve traditional recommender systems while remaining interpretable and user-focused.

## What I’m Exploring Next
- Hallucination detection and confidence scoring for LLM outputs  
- Model interpretability dashboards for ML/LLM systems  
- MLOps practices for deploying and monitoring AI applications  
- AI applications in high-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare, education)
